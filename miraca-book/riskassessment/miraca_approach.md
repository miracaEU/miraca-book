# The Miraca Approach

The MIRACA approach consists of the development of a layered decision-support tool that enhances resilience through adaptation at different levels. The flowchart below describes in detail what the building blocks of the methodology are.

MIRACA’s key innovative aspects consist of:

- Asset-level CI **exposure** and **vulnerabilities** in Europe within a **multi-hazard** context: In the single-and multi-hazard context, there are some gaps regarding asset location and vulnerability attributes and asset characteristics. Through the Use Cases, MIRACA is working on an integrated assessment of CI exposure and vulnerabilities upon multi-hazard events.


- Generalised and transferable **infrastructure network-level models** across Europe: In network analysis, most approaches do not address transboundary interdependencies. MIRACA is developing a transferable modelling framework that captures the interdependencies between networks.


- Multi-scale **systemic risk modelling**: Asset-level damage to CI can have propagating effects within its own network system. The project addresses this with a risk modelling framework that quantifies direct damages and indirect economic losses at different levels within the infrastructure system.


- **Adaptation** for CI systems: MIRACA is developing adaptation strategies that incorporate the multi-scale nature of CI. More specifically, the adaptations range from asset-level measures (e.g. dry-proofing substations) to network-level measures.
