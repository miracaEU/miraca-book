# Introduction to the Use Cases

One of the goals of the Miraca project is to address climate risks and adaptation strategies for different types of critical infrastructure in Europe exposed to different climate hazards. Therefore, 5 Use Cases have been developed, showcasing different tools and methods to carry out asset, network and system level climate risk and adaptation assessments.

Each Use Case focuses on a region, critical infrastructure and hazard. The Cases are being implemented in collaboration with relevant partners in each region, ensuring that the work is relevant to different users, from local stakeholders, operators of critical infrastructure, emergency services or policy regulators.

**Adaptation to Flood and Windstorm Impacts on the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T)**
```

```{tabbed} UC2
**Adaptation to heatwaves, drought and wildfire impact to transport network in Spain** 
```

```{tabbed} UC3
**Adapting Electricity and Telecommunications Infrastructure to Flood Risks in the Netherlands**
```
```{tabbed} UC4
**Climate Adaptation for Healthcare and Educational Infrastructure in Greece** 
Extreme weather conditions triggered by climate change can lead to increased geohazard and hydrological events, affecting vital infrastructures such as hospitals and schools. UC4 will focus on assessing single hazards (earthquake, flood, landslide) and multi-hazards (such as earthquake and flood, or earthquake and landslide) in Central Macedonia, Greece. 

Systemic risk for hospitals is also assessed examining interdependencies with other critical infrastructure, such as the road network. 
**Key stakeholders**
The main stakeholders include:
- Local Municipalities of Northern Greece
- Administrative Region of Central Macedonia
- Ministry for Climate Crisis and Civil Protection of Greece

**Adaptation to Landslide and Flood Impact on Power and Gas Network Reliability in Slovenia**

Slovenia faces increasingly frequent extreme weather events, such as droughts and floods, due to climate change, which poses significant risks to its energy systems. UC5 focuses on analyzing the impact of flooding on the reliability of Slovenia’s power and gas networks.

**Key stakeholders**
The main stakeholders include:
-European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER), ENTSO-E
- ELES, Slovenia’s electricity network operator.
