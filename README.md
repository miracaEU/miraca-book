# Miraca Book

## Building this book

You can build the pages of the book by running `jupyter-book build miraca-book`. As recommended in the [jupyter-book docs](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/start/build.html#aside-source-vs-build-files), the built HTML pages are gitignored on the main branch but can be committed to the `gh-pages` branch.
