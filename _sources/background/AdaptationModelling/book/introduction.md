# Adaptation of Critical Infrastructure

In the context of climate change, adaptating to the impacts of climate extremes is key. The following Notebooks provide an introduction to tools and methods that support the quantification of different adaptation strategies costs and the reduced risks associated to those measures.

- The first two sections: **Direct damages** and **Indirect Losses** focus on the calculation of direct damages of riverine flooding to railway infrastructure. They set the impacts of present and future climate change conditions.

- The following sections: **Costs of adaptation strategies** and **Avoided damages and adaptation costs** quantify how different types of Adaptation measures would result in risk reduction as well as the associated costs. 

These section gives examples of how different types of adaptation, from asset-level interventions, to network-level and system changes result both in Risk reduction.
