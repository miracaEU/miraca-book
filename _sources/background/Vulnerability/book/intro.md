# Vulnerability Database

The MIRACA Harmonized Pan-European Vulnerability Database has been developed within the Horizon Europe project MIRACA to support consistent multi-hazard risk assessment of critical infrastructures across Europe. The database builds upon the open multi-hazard infrastructure vulnerability database developed by Nirandjan et al. (2024), which compiles fragility and vulnerability curves across multiple hazards and infrastructure sectors. Within MIRACA, this database was further enriched, extended, and harmonised to improve sectoral coverage and applicability in large-scale multi-hazard and climate-risk assessments.

Key enhancements introduced in MIRACA include:
- Extension to additional infrastructure asset types (e.g., bridges and tunnels)
- Inclusion of energy, gas, and oil network components
- Integration of single- and multi-hazard vulnerability functions
- Development of fragility surfaces using multiple intensity measures
- Implementation of vulnerability models where fragility curves are unavailable
- Inclusion of cost information for quantitative damage estimation

The vulnerability database is organised into three main datasets:

- **Table_D1_Summary_CI_Vulnerability_Data** – summary information on hazards, exposure classes, vulnerability characteristics, and references  
- **Table_D2_Multi-Hazard_Fragility_and_Vulnerability_Curves** – collection of fragility and vulnerability functions  
- **Table_D3_Costs** – cost information supporting asset damage estimation

The current version of the MIRACA vulnerability database includes vulnerability and fragility information across multiple infrastructure sectors and natural hazards. The figures below summarise the distribution of available vulnerability functions by infrastructure sector and hazard type.
