# Exposure database

Exposure data for critical infrastructure (CI)—assets is one of the first steps towards before carrying out a Climate Risk Assessment. There are multiple ways to access information on critical infrastructure. For country-level assessments, Government and public agencies generally publish information about roads, railways or power network. These datasets often offer high accuracy, and include comprehensive attributes and consistent data. However, some information or specific infrastructure assets might have limited access.

Other sources of data come from international organisations and research institutes, that build on public data sources and, combined with additional sources of data, such as satellite imagery or models. These datasets allow for a large wide coverage. On the other hand, they can have more limited attributes compared to government public datasets and require for

Within MIRACA, the main aim is to provide a framework to support the assessment of the impacts of cliamte change and adaptation on a consistently way at the Pan-European level. In order to have the same level of detail and granularity across countries, while ensuring there is completeness for all critical infrastructure assets, we have retrieved critical infrastructure data from OpenStreetMap (OSM).

## OpenStreetMap (OSM)

OpenStreetMap is a globally collaborative geographic database that is free to access created by a community of mappers,

## Accessing and downloading OSM data

OSMnx is a Python package to easily download, model, analyze, and visualize street networks and other geospatial features from OpenStreetMap.
