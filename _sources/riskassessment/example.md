# Exploring the Miraca approach though a real case example in Belgium

In order to illustrate some of the underlying principles of the methodology, we have developed a country-level, asset and system risk assessment for road infrastructure under riverine flooding. 

The goal of this section is to show in a step-by-step process, how a user can develop a complete climate risk assessment for a given Critical Infrastructure and hazard. The work is divided in two modules:

**Climate Risk Assessment**: This section guides users on how to extract the exposure data on critical infrastructure, obtain hazard data, retrieve the vulnerability curves to relate intensity with damages and the performance of the country-level climate risk assessment

**Systemic Economic Impact**: This section demonstrates the systemic economic effects of the transportation corridor (roads) failure in Belgium. It assesses the implications of disrupted corridors in the country.
